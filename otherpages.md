# Other Pages Sheet

<b>OtherPages</b> sheet contains the other pages data that your website has. Typically every page has a page link, title, and content. So you can edit and add rows as you wish. You can also paste a public **Google Document** to the **$PageContent$** column and it will be rendered as page content. Pages are in the format of a blog post, so you can add blog posts, privacy policy etc. The page content will be rendered between navbar and footer.

Here are columns descriptions:

### $PageLink$

The generated page link for each page. Please do not edit the formula or your website will not be rendered correctly (it's created by the title automatically)

### $PageTitle$

Title to shown in the browser tab for each page

### $PageContent$

You can paste markdown content here or paste a Google Document link such as this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u-WQ2XSnpJY8wS3YtRxrMtYhBw9sp-5BbFcCsysRUk/edit . But there are some ugly <b>limitations</b> in the mobile rendering.
