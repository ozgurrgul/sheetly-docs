# Webhooks

Webhooks are simple links similar to this format:

> https://site.sheetly.page/webhook?sheetId=1bKGzWHB2tnbfqMhkLhfoLCSucPX7rIOr685R1VLH9&wToken=0UjjLH9qM

This link simply triggers re-render of your website thus updates it with the latest cell values in your sheets. There are a few use cases that might be useful for you such as:

- You have a Google Forms and you want to update your Sheetly website automatically when someone submits new form response
- You have a Sheetly website and you want to update it automatically every hour etc
- ...

You can open your Sheetly website's Webhook url in a browser or call from an external webservice etc and it will work.
