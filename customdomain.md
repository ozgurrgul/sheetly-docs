# Custom Domain

In Sheetly, when you create a website, your domain will be in following format:

> site.sheetly.page/$GOOGLE_SHEET_ID$

That means, visitors can access to your website with that link. However, if you want to connect this link to your domain or any subdomain, follow the steps:

1. Buy a domain if you don't have
2. Upgrade your Sheetly account to [PRO](https://sheetly.page)
3. Edit your domains DNS account like the following configuration:

Add **A** record with **@** host value that points to **64.227.16.94**.
If you will have a multi language website, you can edit like following screenshot:

(I added one root domain, and one for spanish version)

4. In your Google Sheet, go to **Settings** sheet and edit **B17** column with your domain
5. Publish your website
6. Visit your domain
7. Voila!

Your old visitors will be redirected to your new domain.
